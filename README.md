# Advent Of Code

My takes on the Advent of Code calendar each year. Where my goal is to try out a different language each year, so I can get more involved in other languages.
Sublanguages like Kotlin and Typescript also count as another language.

## Year List

- 2023 - Rust ⚙ (I wanted to try this for a while now)
- 2022 - Kotlin (A better flavor of Java)
- 2021 - Java ☕ (Used at work)
- 2020 - Python 🐍 (Used in my Minor)
- 2019 - Ruby 💎 (Used in my internship)
- 2018 - Java ☕ (Might switch this for something else as I am not done yet)
