# Advent of Code 2024 (Java)

I picked Java again because I really need to step up my game with the language I use for work. With this I force myself to
actually learn some new API's and methods and to also try them out for the first time.

## Day 1

I always thought the Pair was a default class, but to no avail it's not available anymore in Java 23. It was in the JavaFX package
before. Luckily it's easy to make a class on your own.

This was also the first time I have used `Class.forName` to dynamically get a class and to call a method on it. It was easier than
I expected it to be.

Reminder for myself, don't forget ` Math.abs` last time I forgot it was there and use the min and max functions in the Math class
as substitute ü§¶üèª

`IntStream.rangeClosed` and `IntStream.range` are also useful if you just want to iterate over something with an index.
