# Advent of code year 2021

Because I started working this year at Sogeti I wanted to make my java skills better.
While making a quick java file that could solve the puzzel, I would always refactor some of the code to be better afterwards.
While also getting all the stars this year and waking up early to try out my skills when I am completely 'awake'.
