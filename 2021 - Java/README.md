# Advent of code year 2021

Works with Java 17 or higher.

For example I use:
```java
stream.toList();
```
Which doesn't exist yet in Java 11. If you do however want to run it in Java 11 change the following line of:

```java
List<String> list = stream.toList();
```
To:

```java
List<String> list = stream.map(String::new).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Because I started working this year at Sogeti I wanted to make my java skills better.
While making a quick java file that could solve the puzzel, I would always refactor some of the code to be better afterwards.
While also getting all the stars this year and waking up early to try out my skills when I am completely 'awake'.
